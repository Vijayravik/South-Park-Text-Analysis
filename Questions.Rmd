SOUTH PARK ANALYSIS

I hope to go through a dataset of South Park dialogues, covering seasons 1 - 19, to find out answers for the following questions :

1. How have the sentiments of characters changed over seasons in South Park?

2. What are the typical words that each character speaks?

3. What topics are discussed in South Park?

4. How have the topics discussed on South Park changed over 19 years?

5. Which characters speak together / in sequence?

6. Who is the most verbose character in South Park?
